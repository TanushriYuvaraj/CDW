## CDW
## Charged Density Waves AI

# Phase I 
The project mainly focus onto the available materials from the platform Materials Project where we pull the overall summary of the data availablility and thus play with the machine learning algorithm aspects, to get an insight regarding the model classification of the materials whether it is charge-density wave like behaviour or not, along with the precision, acuracy rate of the model.

# Phase II
The next phase of the project, we intended to predict the classic transition phase of the materials which are predicted as cdw and get an insight of the behaviour ultimately.
